# Face Analysis Attendance System

The Face Analysis Attendance System is a Python-based project that utilizes facial recognition technology to track and manage attendance. The system integrates with MySQL Workbench for database management and MS Excel for generating attendance reports. This README.md provides an overview of the project, its features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Features

1. **Face Detection:** The system can detect faces from images or live video streams using computer vision techniques.

2. **Face Recognition:** Utilizing deep learning-based facial recognition models, the system can recognize known faces and match them with pre-registered individuals.

3. **Attendance Tracking:** The system keeps track of the attendance of recognized individuals, recording their presence for each session.

4. **Database Integration:** MySQL Workbench is used as the database management system to store information related to individuals and their attendance records.

5. **Attendance Reports:** MS Excel is used to generate attendance reports, allowing easy visualization and analysis of attendance data.

6. **User-friendly Interface:** The project incorporates a simple and intuitive user interface for easy interaction with the system.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Face Analysis Attendance System on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-analysis-attendance.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up MySQL Database:** Install MySQL Workbench and create a new database for the attendance system. Update the database connection details in the configuration files of the project.

4. **Set up MS Excel:** Ensure MS Excel is installed on your system and properly configured for Python integration.

5. **Pre-trained Models:** The project may require pre-trained facial recognition models. Download the necessary models and place them in the appropriate directories within the project.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection:** To enroll individuals in the system, collect facial images of each person and add their details to the database. Use the provided user interface to facilitate this process.

2. **Train the Model:** Run the script responsible for training the facial recognition model using the collected data.

```bash
python train_model.py
```

3. **Run the System:** Start the Face Analysis Attendance System by running the main application script.

```bash
python face_analysis_attendance.py
```

4. **Take Attendance:** The system will automatically detect and recognize faces. It will mark the attendance of known individuals and save the data to the database.

5. **Generate Reports:** At the end of each attendance session, use the interface to generate attendance reports. The system will export the data to an MS Excel file for further analysis.
